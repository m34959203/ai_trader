# Stage 1 (Data Platform & API) Readiness

## Scope Recap
Stage 1 establishes the persistent market data layer and the public API surface that downstream stages rely on. The milestone covers schema design, ingestion from external sources, deterministic storage, and operator-facing endpoints (health checks, pagination, and exports).

## Delivered Capabilities
### 1. Unified OHLCV storage & normalization
- The `OHLCV` ORM model stores candles with a composite primary key and supporting indexes, keeping prices and volumes normalized for ingestion and queries.【F:db/models.py†L13-L68】
- Batch upserts validate payloads, coerce types, and perform conflict-aware inserts so repeated loads stay idempotent while retaining performance.【F:db/crud.py†L17-L169】

### 2. Data ingestion and export APIs
- `/prices/store` fetches candles from configured sources, purges duplicates in test environments, and writes normalized bars into the datastore; `/ohlcv` and `/ohlcv.csv` expose strict pagination and streaming CSV export with deterministic column order.【F:routers/ohlcv.py†L56-L200】

### 3. Service wiring and operational endpoints
- The FastAPI application enables trace-aware middleware, standardized error handling, and health probes (`/ping`, `/health`, `/health/deep`, `/healthz`) to validate dependencies, forming the base operational contract for later stages.【F:src/main.py†L820-L920】

### 4. Automated validation
- Integration tests load mocked Binance data, exercise pagination, CSV exports, and error scenarios, while `/prices` endpoints and health checks are validated through dedicated suites to guard regressions.【F:tests/test_ohlcv.py†L119-L315】【F:tests/test_prices_endpoint.py†L9-L45】【F:tests/test_health.py†L5-L18】

## Readiness Assessment
The datastore schema, ingestion APIs, operational endpoints, and regression coverage required for Stage 1 are implemented and exercised end-to-end. **Stage 1 readiness is 100 %, providing a stable foundation for higher stages.**
