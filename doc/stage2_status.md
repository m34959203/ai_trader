# Stage 2 (Advanced Market Intelligence) Readiness

## Scope Recap
Stage 2 covers the enriched feature engineering stack and multi-strategy signal orchestration that feed the automated trading loop. The key deliverables are the technical indicator suite, alternative data ingestion, and the ensemble strategy contract exposed to the platform APIs.

## What is Implemented
- **Broad indicator coverage.** `src/indicators.py` now includes a full library of momentum, volume, candle, and OHLC utilities (Force Index, MFI, OBV, Awesome Oscillator, Heikin-Ashi, candlestick pattern detector, resampling helpers), enabling the expanded feature plan. Robust regression tests cover these indicators, candlestick pattern flags, and resampling helpers. 【F:src/indicators.py†L1-L680】【F:tests/test_indicators.py†L1-L120】
- **Sentiment-aware market analysis.** `analyze_market` fuses these indicators with candle/level logic, multi-timeframe checks, and plugs in aggregated news sentiment so downstream consumers obtain a unified `signal_score`, reasoning trace, and news diagnostics. 【F:src/analysis/analyze_market.py†L1-L462】【F:src/analysis/analyze_market.py†L463-L760】
- **News processing pipeline with automation.** `tasks/news_ingest.py` runs as a background worker (wired into FastAPI startup) to keep `data/news.json` fresh, with CLI support for manual refresh. 【F:tasks/news_ingest.py†L1-L120】【F:src/main.py†L120-L220】【F:src/main.py†L360-L520】
- **Configurable strategy ensembles with validation.** Strategy configs are now validated via Pydantic schemas, ensuring unique strategy names, positive weights, and sane thresholds before producing `StrategyEnsembleConfig`. 【F:src/strategy.py†L1-L240】【F:tests/test_strategy.py†L1-L120】
- **Runtime dependency coverage.** News ingestion dependencies (`feedparser`) are pinned in the core install requirements so the background worker functions in clean deployments without manual package installation. 【F:setup.py†L1-L200】

## Outstanding Items
None — Stage 2 functional and operational scope is fully delivered.

## Readiness Assessment
All Stage 2 deliverables are implemented, automated, and regression tested, and the runtime environment is dependency-complete. **Stage 2 is 100% complete.**
