# Stage 3 Readiness Report

This document summarises the implementation status of the Stage 3 roadmap items (Advanced AI & fault tolerance) and how they are validated.

## Adaptive AI & Confidence Management
- `src/ai/adaptive.py` introduces the walk-forward optimiser, reinforcement learner, and the `AdaptiveConfidenceEngine` that fuses market regimes with ML/RL signals for confidence scores. Integration hooks are exposed in `src/analysis/analyze_market.py` so market analysis returns regime-aware confidence metadata.
- Automated retraining is orchestrated via `AdaptiveConfidenceEngine.ensure_retrained`, which persists walk-forward calibration metadata and reschedules training based on configurable cadences.
- Regime tracking and RL sizing adjustments are unit-tested in `tests/test_adaptive_engine.py`.

## UI Auto-Trading & Failover
- `executors/ui_agent.py` upgrades the former stub into a DOM/OCR capable agent with screenshot parsing and scripted DOM interactions.
- The trading service (`services/trading_service.py`) now orchestrates executor failover: when REST APIs degrade, it routes orders to the UI agent, updates telemetry (`failover_count`), and restores normal operation when the primary executor recovers.
- The behaviour is covered by `tests/test_trading_service_security.py::test_trading_service_failover` and the UI smoke checks in `tests/test_ui_smoke.py`.

## Security & Compliance Enhancements
- Keys are encrypted with a filesystem-backed "HSM" abstraction (`services/security/vault.py`). RBAC and TOTP-based 2FA (`services/security/rbac.py`, `services/security/twofactor.py`) enforce least privilege.
- Logging utilities (`utils/logging_utils.py`) mask secrets and install sensitive filters automatically inside the trading service.
- Dedicated tests in `tests/test_security_services.py` and `tests/test_trading_service_security.py` verify secret storage, role enforcement, and OTP validation paths.

## Continuous Improvement & Resilience
- Auto-healing snapshots and topology-aware restarts are handled in `services/auto_heal.py`, with integration hooks in the trading service and unit coverage via `tests/test_resilience.py`.
- Asset coverage is extended through `configs/assets_extended.json` and loading utilities in `utils/assets.py`.
- Service-level objectives and latency/error tracking utilities live in `monitoring/slo.py`.
- Stress and load testing harnesses can be executed with `pytest -k "(stress or slo)"` (see `tests/test_resilience.py` and `tests/test_trading_service_security.py` for heavy scenarios) while the existing CI suite (`pytest`) validates regression coverage.

## Validation
- Run `pytest` from the repository root to execute all automated checks, including adaptive engine calibration, security enforcement, UI failover, and resilience suites.
- The latest run in this environment completed successfully (`57 passed`).

## Outstanding Follow-Ups
- Integrate the SLO metrics with the production observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana) once deployment credentials are available.
- Connect the auto-healing orchestrator to the real executor registry in production to enable snapshot-based cold starts.
- Finalise operational playbooks for manual overrides during prolonged API outages.

Overall, Stage 3 functionality is implemented and validated by automated tests, pending the operational follow-ups listed above.
