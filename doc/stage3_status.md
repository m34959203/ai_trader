# Stage 3 Readiness Report

Stage 3 focuses on the paper-trading loop, execution resilience, and observability required before enabling automated trading in production-like environments.

## Simulation & Paper Trading
- `routers/trading.py` exposes `/paper/backtest` with enriched outputs: win rate, PnL, Sharpe metrics, equity curve, and optional CSV/JSON exports for trades/equity, satisfying the “journal export” deliverable. 【F:routers/trading.py†L520-L720】
- `src/paper.py` keeps a detailed trade ledger (fees, SL/TP hits, holding time, reasons) and enforces SL/TP/trailing logic consistently for long and short scenarios. 【F:src/paper.py†L1-L200】【F:src/paper.py†L201-L400】
- Equity reconstruction helpers build normalized equity curves so analytics can be consumed by dashboards/tests. 【F:routers/trading.py†L640-L720】

## Execution Resilience & Risk Controls
- `services/trading_service.py` includes per-trade sizing, daily loss/trade limits, and portfolio risk caps before order submission, while integrating auto-healing and executor failover. The orchestrator now persists primary-executor snapshots, auto-replays them on startup, and reports recovery success into Prometheus SLOs. 【F:services/trading_service.py†L160-L360】【F:services/auto_heal.py†L1-L200】【F:tests/test_resilience.py†L1-L120】
- `services/reconcile.py` compares on-exchange positions with the internal journal, writing compensating entries to keep ledgers aligned without manual intervention. 【F:services/reconcile.py†L1-L200】【F:services/reconcile.py†L200-L400】
- `services/broker_gateway.py` now includes a production-ready `BinanceBrokerGateway` alongside the simulator, while `/live/status` and `/live/trade` expose model-routed executions for live integrations. 【F:services/broker_gateway.py†L1-L210】【F:routers/live_trading.py†L1-L60】

## Security & Operational Hardening
- Secrets are stored via the filesystem vault with RBAC+2FA guards, and trading-service logs scrub sensitive fields automatically. 【F:services/trading_service.py†L40-L140】
- Auto-healing snapshots, executor registry replays, and Prometheus instrumentation are wired into the trading service; resilience and observability pipelines are covered by dedicated tests. 【F:monitoring/observability.py†L1-L120】【F:routers/metrics.py†L1-L80】【F:tests/test_resilience.py†L80-L140】
- Observability dependencies (`prometheus-client`) are part of the core installation set, guaranteeing `/metrics` availability in clean environments. 【F:setup.py†L1-L200】
- Operational runbooks document news ingestion, auto-heal procedures, Prometheus onboarding, and paper-trading validation for day-two readiness. 【F:doc/runbooks.md†L1-L80】

## Readiness Assessment
Simulation, journaling, automated risk checks, and operational runbooks are production-ready with observability and auto-heal wiring in place, and all runtime dependencies are declared. **Stage 3 is 100% complete.**

## Transition to Stage 4
All remaining go-live activities—brokerage certification, production observability, compliance controls, and operator tooling—are now tracked under **Stage 4 (Live Trading & Operator Experience)**. Refer to `doc/stage4_status.md` for the active backlog and progress indicators.【F:doc/stage4_status.md†L1-L56】
