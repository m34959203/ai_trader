# Stage 3 Readiness Report

Stage 3 focuses on the paper-trading loop, execution resilience, and observability required before enabling automated trading in production-like environments.

## Simulation & Paper Trading
- `routers/trading.py` exposes `/paper/backtest` with enriched outputs: win rate, PnL, Sharpe metrics, equity curve, and optional CSV/JSON exports for trades/equity, satisfying the “journal export” deliverable. 【F:routers/trading.py†L520-L720】
- `src/paper.py` keeps a detailed trade ledger (fees, SL/TP hits, holding time, reasons) and enforces SL/TP/trailing logic consistently for long and short scenarios. 【F:src/paper.py†L1-L200】【F:src/paper.py†L201-L400】
- Equity reconstruction helpers build normalized equity curves so analytics can be consumed by dashboards/tests. 【F:routers/trading.py†L640-L720】

## Execution Resilience & Risk Controls
- `services/trading_service.py` includes per-trade sizing, daily loss/trade limits, and portfolio risk caps before order submission, while integrating auto-healing and executor failover. 【F:services/trading_service.py†L1-L220】【F:services/trading_service.py†L480-L720】
- `services/reconcile.py` compares on-exchange positions with the internal journal, writing compensating entries to keep ledgers aligned without manual intervention. 【F:services/reconcile.py†L1-L200】【F:services/reconcile.py†L200-L400】

## Security & Operational Hardening
- Secrets are stored via the filesystem vault with RBAC+2FA guards, and trading-service logs scrub sensitive fields automatically. 【F:services/trading_service.py†L40-L140】
- Auto-healing snapshots and restart orchestration are plumbed into the trading service, with failover to UI/exchange executors covered by resilience tests (see `tests/test_resilience.py`).

## Outstanding Follow-Ups
- **Observability integration.** Prometheus/Grafana wiring for SLO metrics (`monitoring/slo.py`) still needs deployment scripts and dashboards.
- **Auto-heal production hook-up.** Connect `AutoHealingOrchestrator` to the live executor registry so cold-start recovery runs outside of tests.
- **Operational playbooks.** Produce runbooks for manual overrides during prolonged API outages, including 2FA recovery and reconciliation procedures.

## Readiness Assessment
Simulation, journaling, and automated risk checks are production-quality, and resilience features are implemented with automated coverage. Remaining work is operational (observability integration, production auto-heal wiring, formal playbooks). **Stage 3 is ~85% complete**, pending those rollout tasks.
